* Understand the problem

Find unique element in an array.

* Devise a plan

Group elements by their transformation and return the one that is unique.  Time and space complexity are $O(n)$.

** Carry out the plan

#+begin_src python
  class Solution:
      def oddString(self, words: List[str]) -> str:
          g = defaultdict(list)
          for w in words:
              g[tuple(ord(b) - ord(a) for a, b in zip(w, w[1:]))].append(w)
          for v in g.values():
              if len(v) == 1:
                  return v[0]
