#+TITLE: Leetcode: 929. Unique Email Addresses

[[https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets/][Problem Statement]].

A normalization of the e-mails is needed to count the number of distinct e-mails.  To do so, you can first split the e-mail by ~@~ and extract local and domain part.  From the local, you take the prefix before the first ~+~ and remove all ~.~ from it.  After the normalization, you can remove the duplicates by adding all them to a set.

- Time and space complexity: $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of e-mails.

  class Solution:
      def numUniqueEmails(self, emails: List[str]) -> int:
          def normalize(email):
              local, domain = email.split("@")
              base = local.split("+")[0].replace(".", "")
              return base + "@" + domain

          return len(set(map(normalize, emails)))
