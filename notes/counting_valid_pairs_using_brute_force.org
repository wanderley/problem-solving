#+TITLE: Counting valid pairs using Brute Force

* Prompts / Hints

- *How can you group the values to make easy to avoid counting invalid pairs?*

  - Each element should be only in one group.

  - Elements of the same group should create an invalid pair.

- *Do the problem's constraints allows the computation of the intersection of the groups?*

  - Be $n$ the number of groups and $m$ the time to compute the intersection of two groups.  The problem's constraints should allow an solution of $O(n \times m)$.

* Method

1. Compute all groups
2. Start counter equals to 0.
3. For each pair of groups $A$ and $B$, sums to the counter $|A \setminus (A \cap B)| \times |B \setminus (A \cap B)|$.
