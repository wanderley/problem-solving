- Not much, since this is an elementary problem.

- Retrospective
  - Pros
    - Found solution by first guessing the complexity ($O(n^2 \times m^2)$ won't pass, $O(n \times m^2)$ would pass) and then translating it back to the problem (e.g. I would have to fix the bottom of the rectangle and iterate over the its sides).
  - Cons
    - Did not follow the method to see if I could find a $O(n \times m)$ solution.
