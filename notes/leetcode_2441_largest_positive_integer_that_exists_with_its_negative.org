* Understand the problem

Given an array $a$, find the largest integer $k$ such that $-k$ is also in $a$.

** Useful prompts

- [[id:29512D97-A54D-42F9-A8C7-C3422881933B][Can we use brute-force to solve the problem?]]

* Devise a plan

Use a ~set~ to store numbers of $a$ and for each one $x$ from the largest to the smaller, check if $-x$ is also in the set.

** Carry out the plan

#+begin_src python
  class Solution:
      def findMaxK(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
          seen = set(nums)
          for n in sorted(nums, reverse=True):
              if -n in seen:
                  return n
          return -1
