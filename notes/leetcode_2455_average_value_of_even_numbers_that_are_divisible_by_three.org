* Understand the problem

Find the median of numbers divisible by 2 and 3.

* Devise the plan

Filter numbers divisible by 6 and compute their average.  Time and space complexity is $O(n)$.

** Carry out the plan

#+begin_src python
  class Solution:
      def averageValue(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
          xs = [n for n in nums if n % 2 == 0 and n % 3 == 0]
          if not xs:
              return 0
          return floor(sum(xs) / len(xs))
