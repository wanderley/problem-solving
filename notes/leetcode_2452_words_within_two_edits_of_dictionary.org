#+TITLE: Leetcode: 2452. Words Within Two Edits of Dictionary

* Understand the problem

Given a dictionary and queries, return a subarray of queries which each query $q$ appear in the dictionary if edit distance (only change) at most 2.

* Devise a plan

[[id:BC81A358-FBCC-43AA-9928-E9778A107869][Pattern: Small constraints could allow a brute-force solution]].  For each query, compute the edit distance to all words in the dictionary and add it to the output if the distance is at most 2.

** Carry out the plan

#+begin_src python
  class Solution:
      def twoEditWords(self, queries: List[str], dictionary: List[str]) -> List[str]:
          return [
              q
              for q in queries
              if any(sum(a != b for a, b in zip(q, d)) <= 2 for d in dictionary)
          ]
