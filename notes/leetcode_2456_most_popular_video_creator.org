* Understand the problem

Find the creators with max total views and their respective creation most viewed.  Views of a single creation don't aggregate if they appear multiple times in the report.

* Devise a plan

[[id:48E699CB-3125-47FF-AA1A-5FCCF0EF235E][Can we simulate the problem?]] Yes! Compute the popularity while keeping track of the creation most viewed.

** Carry out the plan

  class Solution:
      def mostPopularCreator(
          self, creators: List[str], ids: List[str], views: List[int]
      ) -> List[List[str]]:
          popularity = Counter()

          for c, i, v in zip(creators, ids, views):
              popularity[c] += v
              total_views[c][i] = max(total_views[c][i], v)
          maxp = max(popularity.values())
